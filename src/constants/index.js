  This is a symbol of an Urimmm (meaning Lights), and a Thummim (meaning Perfections). They are two holy objects used by Jewish Priests to cast lots in order to know GOD's will

  The LOTS Website was designed, and created by a private company as a headstart to enable you to draw near to GOD, and know his will for your life by casting LOTS.

Lots are words, which are utterances, or 'rhema's'. Not only it is biblical, but the given method of knowing the Holy Spirit's  will over our own.

Leviticus, Joshua, Samuel, 1 Chronicles, Nehemiah, Psalms, Joel, Obadiah, Jonah, Nahum, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts **ALL** speak of lots, which are rhema's.

Proverbs 16:33 states it **BEST** and very clearly, that it is the recommended way to ask GOD/Jehovah/Father to decide for us:
The lot is cast into the lap, but the disposing of it is from Jehovah. -Proverbs 16:33

Now, the whole disposing of it is from Jehovah means that GOD is the one making the decision. He does this through his Holy Spirit.
Therefore, Lots is the best way to get the Word and opinion of the LORD when you do not yet hear his still samll 
voice. This is the reason it is spoken of annd use so much in the Bible. Jesus instructs us to bind lying spirits and 
confess prior to doing this, each time you do it.

Also, there's **Leviticus 16:8:** "And Aaron shall cast **lots** upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat

**Joshua 18:6:** After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me and I will cast **lots** for you in the presence of the Lord our God.

**Joshua 18:8:** As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed them, “Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast **lots** for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the Lord.”

**Joshua 18:10:** Joshua then cast **lots** for them in Shiloh in the presence of the Lord, and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions.** 

**1 Samuel 4:42:** And Saul said, cast **lots** between  me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken

**1 Chronicles 24:31:** These likewise cast **lots** over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Achimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.

**1 Chronicles 25:8:** And they cast **lots**, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.

**1 Chronicles 26:13:** And they cast **lots**, as well as the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

**1 Chronnicles 26:14:** And the **lot** eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counsellor, they cast **lots**; and his **lot** came out northward.

**Nehemiah 10:34:** And we cast the **lots** among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offerinng, to bring it into the house of our GOD, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year
by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our GOD, as it is written in the law:

**Nehemiah 11:1:** And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast **lots** to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city; and nine parts to dwell in other cities.

**Psalm 22:18:** They part my garments among them, and cast **lots** upon my venture.

**Joel 3:3:** And they have cast **lots** for my people; and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, they they might drink.

**Obadiah 1:11:** On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast **lots** for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.

**Jonah 1:7:** And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast **lots**, that we may know whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast **lots**, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

**Nahum 3:10:** Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast **lots** for her honorable men, ad all her great men were bound in chains.

**Matthew 27:35:** And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting **lots**: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, annd 
upon my venture did they cast **lots**

**Mark 15:24:** And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

**Luke 23:34:** Then said Jesus, Father forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment and cast **lots**

**Acts 1:26:** And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

Lots are in 21 verses of the King James Bible. The Bible itself says to use them to obtain the Word of GOD through the work of the Holy Spirit!
It also instructs us exactly how to use them, and this is how the "Rhema" mentioned materialized.

This is as old as the Bible itself and has been a very reliable way of communicating with our dear Jesus through his Holy Spirit, to all 
who have prayed first, bound the Lying Spirits, and aksed the LORD to reveal his will to them through the Rhema. 

Try it and you will quickly find that it is absolutely the power of the Holy Spirit directing the outcome. The same works when using a Bible, the Bible
Promises Book and even when you set a Christian Music Playlist to "Random or Shuffle". Jesus always seems to play two of his
favorite songs in a row when you ask him to shuffle the music for you.

Please  do not get caught up in debates with those who may not know the truth, decide for yourself using the information provided
from the Bible. Test it for yourself and leave it between you and Jesus whether or not it's his method. It will not take long for you to 
see a avery obvious intelligent control over the results depending on your situation at that time.

I hope this has blessed all of you! GOD bless you all! Glory be to GOD for this very helpful tool for us!
